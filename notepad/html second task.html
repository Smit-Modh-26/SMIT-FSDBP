<center><h1><u><b>Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML</b></u></h1></center>

<p style = "color:red">Welcome to The Digital Business. Here you will learn the basics of the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), so that you make your own web pages like the one you are viewing right now.</p>

<p style = "color:blue">HTML is not programming language, but rather a markup language. If you already know XML, than HTML will be a snap for you to learn. We urge you not to attemp to blow through this tutorial in one sitting. We recommend that you spend 15 minutes to an hour a day practicing HTML and than take a break, to let the information settle in. We aren't going anywhere!</p>

<h2><b>Preparation for HTML</b></h2>
<p>Creating an HTML document is easy. <mark>To begin coding HTML</mark> you need only two things:a simple text editor and the dedication to follow our tutorial! Notepad is the most basic of simple-text editors and you will probably code a fair amount of HTML with it.</p>

<p style="color:red;background-color:yellow">If you are new to HTML and haven't read through the <u>Beginner's Tutorial,</u> please take a few minutes to complete that tutorial before moving on.</p>

<h2><b><u>Brief HTML Background</u></b></h2>

<p>HTML has not been around for many years. November 1990 marks the day of the first web page and back then there were little to no HTML standards to be followed. A group called the <u>World Wide Web Consortium</u> was then formed and since set the standards that are widely accepted and we will base our teachings around them.</p>
